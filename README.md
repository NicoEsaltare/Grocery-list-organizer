# grocery-list-organizer
My grocery list organized by Isles in my grocery store

This program has a dictionary of items I consistently purchase correspoding with the isle they are on. The output in the terminal is what I want but written to the json file is not in the right format. I want the json file to look exactly like the output in the terminal. I also want to add a function to be able to add new items to the dictionary and what isle they are on.
